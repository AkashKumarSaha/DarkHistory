    """ Compute f(z) fractions for continuum photons, photoexcitation of HI, and photoionization of HI, HeI, HeII

    Given a spectrum of deposited electrons and photons, resolve their energy into continuum photons,
    HI excitation, and HI, HeI, HeII ionization in that order.

    Parameters
     ----------
    spec_phot : Spectrum object
        spectrum of photons. Assumed to be in dNdE mode. spec.totN() should return number _per baryon_ per time.
    spec_elec : Spectrum object
        spectrum of electrons. Assumed to be in dNdE mode. spec.totN() should return number _per baryon_ per time.
    x : list of floats
        number of (HI, HeI, HeII) divided by nH at redshift photon_spectrum.rs
    dE_dVdt : float
        DM energy injection rate, dE/dVdt injected.
    time_step : float
        The time-step associated with the deposited spectra, in seconds.
    method : {'old','ion','new'}
        'old': All photons >= 13.6eV ionize hydrogen, within [10.2, 13.6)eV excite hydrogen, < 10.2eV are labelled continuum.
        'ion': Same as 'old', but now photons >= 13.6 can ionize HeI and HeII also.
        'new': Same as 'ion', but now [10.2, 13.6)eV photons treated more carefully.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of floats
    f_c(z) for z within spec.rs +/- time_step/2
    The order of the channels is {continuum photons, HI excitation, HI ionization, HeI ion, HeII ion}

    NOTE
    ----
    The CMB component hasn't been subtracted from the continuum photons yet
    Think about the exceptions that should be thrown (spec_elec.rs should equal spec_phot.rs)
